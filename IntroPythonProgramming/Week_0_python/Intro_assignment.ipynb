    "- An introduction to Jupyter Notebooks and the format of the assignments\n",

These slides will have a mix of helpful hints, guidelines, and what the expected outcomes should be (particularly for plots). There is a good chance that any question you have will have an answer in those slides, so check them first. \n",

If you pass the autograder checks here, then (probably) you will pass the Gradescope autograder. **You should always check the result of the Gradescope autograder and make sure you got full credit.** If you don't, the reason you didn't is (probably) here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tYa5oycUiG4YhXUq5vHvPOpWJ4k_xUPp2rUNIL7Q9RI/edit?usp=sharing.
