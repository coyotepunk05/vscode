#  instead of just a box... say a trapezoid

    # YOUR CODE HERE

    # The unit vector normal to the sloped wall.

    # Reflect the normal element of the position by subtracting the doubled normal offset.

#
# Similar to above, except these are circular bumpers, defined by a center x,y and a radius.

# TODO
# Define your own function here for calculating the intersection of the pinball with the bumper
# For bumper_reflection function, call the reflect_wall function but calculate a_b_c of the tangent line of the bumper.

# YOUR CODE HERE
    # call reflect_wall (thought as the wall tangent to the bumper at the colliding point.)


# TODO: Put routines to check answers here
if __name__ == '__main__':

    # Left wall
    # Right wall
    # And last, but not least, the reflect function
